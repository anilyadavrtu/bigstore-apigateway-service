# bigstore-apigateway-service
bigstore-apigateway-service | Zuul acts as an API gateway or Edge service. It receives all the requests coming from the UI and then delegates the requests to internal microservices. So, I have bigstore-apigateway-service new microservice which is Zuul-enabled, and this service sits on top of all other microservices. It acts as an Edge service or client-facing service. Its Service API should be exposed to the client/UI. The client calls this service as a proxy for an internal microservice, then this service delegates the request to the appropriate service.   The advantage of this type of design is that common aspects like CORS, authentication, and security can be put into a centralized service, so all common aspects will be applied on each request, and if any changes occur in the future, we just have to update the business logic of this Edge Service.  Also, we can implement any routing rules or any filter implementation. Say we want to append a special tag into the request header before it reaches the internal microservices, we can do it in the Edge service.  As the Edge service itself is a microservice, it can be independently scalable and deployable, so we can perform some load testing.
